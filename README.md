# Sarcasm-Detection-NLP-Project
This repository contains the Sarcasm Detection binary classification project for natural language processing.

## Description
In this project, I used tensorflow to build an NLP model to classify sentences based on whether they may be sarcastic or not. I first download the json file of the dataset, then preproces it for training by tokenizing the keywords and splitting them into different groups. I then use a simple ANN for training, with some visual analysis at the end.

## How to run the project
You can run it on your local IDE or google colab. The steps are pretty simple. I followed Deeplearning.AI's tutorial on deep learning for the project. I also followed [Laurence Moroney's youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNxaJsNG3-s&list=PLQY2H8rRoyvzDbLUZkbudP-MFQZwNmU4S) for added reference.
